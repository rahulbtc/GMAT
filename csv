That claim could be paraphrased to say: without social interaction, mental sharpness would be reduced.

Now read B):
Many medical conditions and treatments that adversely affect a person's mental sharpness also tend to increase that person's social isolation.

And since B) has a classic GMAT style double-negative, let's paraphrase B) too:
Many medical conditions and treatments that reduce mental sharpness also tend to reduce social interaction.

SC,Correct,E,E,650-700,Parallelism,
SC,Incorrect,E,D,700-750,Parallelism,"Sure, I'd be happy to explain in more detail.

The sentence is talking about the observers' current view and their prediction about the future. The observers &quot;see&quot; the Middle East as unstable now, and they &quot;believe&quot; it &quot;will be or could&quot; become less volatile in the future. This is a prediction about the future, so we use &quot;will&quot; not &quot;would&quot;. 

Let's break down the difference between &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; in this context:

1. &quot;Will&quot; is used to talk about future events that are predicted or expected to happen. It's a definite statement about the future. In this case, the observers believe that the Middle East &quot;will&quot; become less volatile - they are predicting a definite future event.

2. &quot;Would&quot; is used to talk about hypothetical situations or events that are not guaranteed to happen. It's often used in conditional sentences, to talk about something that might happen if certain conditions are met. In this case, using &quot;would&quot; suggests that the Middle East becoming less volatile is a hypothetical situation, not a definite prediction.

So, the use of &quot;will&quot; or &quot;would&quot; depends on whether the observers are making a definite prediction about the future (use &quot;will&quot;) or discussing a hypothetical situation (use &quot;would&quot;).

In option E, &quot;think the Middle East would or could&quot; suggests that the observers are discussing a hypothetical situation, not making a definite prediction. But the original sentence suggests that the observers are making a definite prediction about the future, so &quot;will&quot; is the correct word to use.

Also, option E changes the meaning of the sentence by removing the phrase &quot;at present&quot; which indicates the current state of the Middle East. This makes option E less accurate than option D.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

If this is true, then we would expect customers to tip LESS when they are reminded that their spending power is LESS than the cash they currently have available.

Huh? Well, think about a man who is in debt. He might have $100 in his pocket, but he owes his friend $500. He might have been ready to give a $5 tip, but as soon as he remembers that he owes money, he decides to give $3-4 instead.

Although choice (B) presents a scenario that is the opposite of the one presented in the passage, both scenarios support the same theory, which is that being reminded of your spending power can impact how much you tip. Generally, this causes people to tip more because they are reminded that their spending power exceeds the cash they have. However, for people in credit card debt, seeing the logo is a reminder that their spending power is actually lower.

So if choice (B) is true, it would support the psychologists' hypothesis. Keep this one."

DS,Correct,C,C,700-750,Percent and Interest Problems,"Sure, let's break down this problem step by step. 

The question is asking us to compare the amount of interest earned at two different rates: 2% and 2.5%. The account earns 2% interest until it reaches $1,000, and then it earns 2.5% interest. We want to know if the total amount of interest earned at the 2% rate is greater than the total amount earned at the 2.5% rate.

1. Statement One: The account earned exactly $25 in interest at the 2.5% rate.

This statement tells us how much interest was earned at the 2.5% rate, but it doesn't tell us anything about how much was earned at the 2% rate. We don't know the initial balance of the account, so we can't calculate how much interest was earned at the 2% rate. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement Two: The account was open for exactly three years.

This statement tells us the total time the account was open, but it doesn't tell us how long it took for the balance to reach $1,000. Therefore, we can't determine how long the account was earning 2% interest versus 2.5% interest. This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

3. Statements One and Two Together:

When we consider both statements together, we can figure out the answer. From statement one, we know that the account earned $25 at the 2.5% rate. From statement two, we know that the account was open for three years. 

We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate how long it took for the account to earn $25 at the 2.5% rate. This will tell us how long the account was earning 2.5% interest. We can then subtract this time from the total time the account was open (three years) to find out how long the account was earning 2% interest.

Once we know how long the account was earning 2% interest, we can calculate how much interest was earned during this period. We can then compare this amount to the $25 earned at the 2.5% rate to answer the question.

The question is asking us to explain why Sammy's aunt and Pat's brother had contrasting experiences with the same diet. The diet in question is the one that includes large amounts of wheat germ and garlic. Sammy's aunt had a positive experience with this diet, while Pat's brother had a negative one.

You eliminated options A, B, and E, and were left with options C and D. Let's examine these two options:

C. Arthritis is a chronic condition whose symptoms improve and worsen from time to time without regard to diet.

D. In general, men are more likely to have their arthritis symptoms alleviated by avoiding vegetables in the nightshade family than are women.

You chose option D, which suggests that gender and the avoidance of certain vegetables (nightshade family) could explain the contrasting experiences. However, the diet in question does not involve avoiding vegetables from the nightshade family. Therefore, this option does not provide a valid explanation for the contrasting experiences with the wheat germ and garlic diet.

On the other hand, option C suggests that the symptoms of arthritis can improve or worsen over time, regardless of diet. This could explain why Sammy's aunt and Pat's brother had different experiences with the same diet. The changes they experienced could be due to the natural progression of the disease, not the diet."

You chose option D because you thought that if bankers are not willing to lend to businesses with insufficient prospective earnings, then the increase in available funds for loans wouldn't matter because the businesses that need the loans wouldn't be able to get them. This is a valid concern, but it doesn't directly address the effectiveness of the government's plan to increase the amount of money available for development loans.

The government's plan is to increase the pool of money available for loans, not to ensure that every business will be able to secure a loan. The willingness of bankers to lend to certain businesses is a separate issue. Even if some businesses can't secure loans due to their insufficient prospective earnings, the government's plan could still be effective if it increases the total amount of money available for loans. That's why option D doesn't raise the most serious doubt about the effectiveness of the government's plan.

On the other hand, option A directly challenges the effectiveness of the government's plan. It suggests that even if more money is deposited into retirement savings accounts, and thus more money becomes available to borrowers, this might not benefit businesses because consumer borrowing could increase correspondingly. This could mean that the additional funds would be absorbed by consumer loans, leaving the amount of money available for business development loans unchanged. This directly contradicts the government's expectation that their plan will increase the funds available for business loans.

So, while your reasoning for option D is understandable, it doesn't directly counter the government's plan as effectively as option A does. 

Does this make sense? Can you see why option A might raise a more serious doubt about the effectiveness of the government's plan than option D?"

I could easily understand that A was sufficient. (please refer to Bunuel's official explanation, that's the best, as always.)

The trick was with the second option (at least I felt that, as I took a bit longer than usual to mark the correct answer. I was almost about to mark A as the correct answer) :

Note the term: &quot;Distinct positive integers&quot; (This is always something I happen to miss out, initially, especially when moving on from one statement to the other, in a data sufficiency question.)
Each number must be different. 

Let's talk about the second statement:
we know a+b+c+d = 240

Now, we also know, the mean of the 4 numbers = 50.
That can mean:
(b+c)/2 = 50
or, (b+c) = 100
again, note the word: &quot;distinct integers&quot;. As per the question, we should look at any other scenarios other than b = c.
Which means, b must be 49, or any number less than 49.
and c must be 51 or any number more than 51.
again, we must also note that a+d = 140.
However, we don't need to do too much of calculations.
We can simply take a to be 40, b to be 49 (max possible number for b), 51(least possible number for c), and 100 (d).

possible combinations:
40, 49, 51, 100 (average = 60, median = 50)
41, 48, 52, 99 (average = 60, median = 50)
35, 40, 60, 105 (average = 60, median = 50)
1, 2, 98, 139 (average = 60, median = 50)
and so on... Note that in each case, we can see that there are only 2 numbers that can be less than 50.

Also, remember: while calculating median, the numbers must be arranged in ascending order. 

So, we have 2 numbers less than 50. (which is sufficient)

So, 1 and 2 both are sufficient, independently.
Correct answer: D

Let me know if there are any discrepancies in my explanation. (This problem looked really interesting to me, so I thought of explaining it here)"

&quot;Estimated to be&quot;: This is the correct usage when you're making an estimate about something that is not a numerical value. The phrase &quot;to be&quot; is used when the estimate is about a state or condition. For example, &quot;The cost is estimated to be high&quot; or &quot;The time of arrival is estimated to be 14:40&quot;. Here, the estimates are about a state (high cost) or a condition (time of arrival).

&quot;Estimated at&quot;: This phrase is used when the estimate is a numerical value. For example, &quot;The cost is estimated at $100&quot; or &quot;The population is estimated at 1 million&quot;. Here, the estimates are numerical values ($100, 1 million).

&quot;Estimated as&quot;: This phrase is less commonly used and is generally not preferred in formal English. It might be used when the estimate is about a classification or category. For example, &quot;The project is estimated as high risk&quot;. However, even in this case, &quot;to be&quot; would be more commonly used: &quot;The project is estimated to be high risk&quot;.

In the context of your sentence, the estimate is about a condition (time of arrival), so &quot;estimated to be&quot; is the correct usage. The phrase &quot;estimated at 14:40&quot; would imply that 14:40 is a numerical value, which is not the case here. And &quot;estimated as 14:40&quot; is simply incorrect because 14:40 is not a classification or category."

If the numbers added are far from the mean, they tend to increase the standard deviation, because they make the data points more spread out. If the numbers added are exactly at the mean, they do not change the standard deviation.

I. Adding 14 and 16 to the set {9,12,15,18,21} would not significantly change the standard deviation, because these numbers are close to the mean of the set (15).

II. Adding 9 and 21 to the set {9,12,15,18,21} would increase the standard deviation. Even though these numbers are already in the set, adding them again effectively creates more &quot;extreme&quot; values, which increases the spread of the data.

III. Adding 15 and 100 to the set {9,12,15,18,21} would significantly increase the standard deviation, because 100 is far from the mean of the set, making the data points more spread out.

&quot;Who&quot; is used as a subject (the one doing the action).
&quot;Whom&quot; is used as an object (the one receiving the action).
In the sentence, &quot;who/whom the National Press Club had just elected as their first female member&quot;, the National Press Club is doing the action (electing), and Helen Thomas is receiving the action (being elected). Therefore, &quot;whom&quot; would technically be the correct choice.

However, in modern English, especially in American English, &quot;who&quot; is often used in casual speech and writing even when &quot;whom&quot; would be technically correct. This might have added to the confusion.

The real issue in the sentence, as you correctly identified, was not with &quot;who&quot; vs. &quot;whom&quot;, but with the tense of the verb. The past perfect tense (&quot;had elected&quot;) is needed to indicate that the election happened before another past event (the speech).

It's possible that the &quot;who&quot; vs. &quot;whom&quot; issue caught your attention and distracted you from noticing the verb tense issue. This is a common trap in sentence correction questions - minor issues or common misconceptions can distract from the main point.

To avoid this in the future, it might be helpful to read the entire sentence carefully and consider the overall meaning and structure, rather than focusing too much on one specific part. Also, keep practicing and reviewing grammar rules and their applications. Over time, you'll become more comfortable with these concepts and more adept at spotting the real issues in sentence correction questions. 

Yes, you are correct. In formal English grammar, &quot;whom&quot; is indeed the correct choice in this context because it is the object of the verb &quot;elected&quot;. The National Press Club (the subject) is performing the action (election) on Helen Thomas (the object)."

2. **Overemphasis on Certain Keywords**: The repetition of &quot;injury rates&quot; in option B might have made it seem like a correct choice. However, it's crucial to consider the entire sentence structure and meaning, not just individual keywords.

3. **Sentence Structure**: Option B results in a sentence that is not grammatically correct. Developing a strong understanding of sentence structure and grammar rules can help avoid such mistakes.

To avoid such mistakes in the future, it's important to carefully read and understand what is being compared in the sentence. Also, consider the entire sentence structure and meaning, not just individual keywords or phrases. 

Remember, in sentence correction questions, the correct answer will not only be grammatically correct but will also convey the intended meaning of the sentence accurately."

The subjunctive mood is used in English for various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred. In this sentence, however, the subjunctive mood is not being tested.

You might have chosen option B because it seems to correct the original sentence by adding the &quot;to&quot; after &quot;requiring&quot;, which makes the sentence grammatically correct. However, option B still uses the incorrect idiom &quot;so as to&quot;, which is why it's not the correct answer.

The phrase &quot;so as to&quot; is often used to indicate the purpose or intention of an action, but in this context, the more appropriate phrase is &quot;so that they can&quot;, which clearly indicates the purpose of the unpaid leave.

Remember, on the GMAT Sentence Correction, it's not enough for a sentence to be just grammatically correct. It also has to be logically and idiomatically correct. So even though option B might seem grammatically correct, it's not the best answer because it doesn't use the most appropriate idiom.

In the context of the sentence you provided, &quot;they&quot; clearly refers to &quot;workers&quot;, so there's no ambiguity.

Remember, on the GMAT, pronoun ambiguity is considered less of an error than other grammatical errors. If all other things are equal, a sentence with clear grammar and idiomatic usage is preferred, even if there might be some potential for pronoun ambiguity."

I. 31st smallest term is zero: In an AP, the sum of the terms equidistant from the beginning and end is always the same. This is because the common difference adds the same amount to the next term as it subtracts from the previous term. Since the sum of the first 31 terms is zero, the 16th term (which is the middle term of the first 31 terms) must be zero. However, this does not necessarily mean that the 31st term is zero. The AP could be decreasing, in which case the 31st term would be negative. So, this statement is not necessarily true.

II. 16th largest term is zero: As explained above, the 16th term of the AP is zero. If the sequence is increasing, the 16th largest term would indeed be zero. However, if the sequence is decreasing, the 16th largest term would not be zero. So, this statement is not necessarily true.

III. The sum of the largest and smallest terms of the sequence is positive: This statement depends on the specific values of the largest and smallest terms, which we do not know. If the sequence is increasing, the sum would indeed be positive. However, if the sequence is decreasing, the sum could be negative. So, this statement is not necessarily true.





An increasing arithmetic progression (AP): Let's say the AP is 1, 2, 3, ..., 46. In this case, the sum of the first 31 terms is not zero, so this AP does not satisfy the condition given in the question.

A decreasing AP: Let's say the AP is 46, 45, 44, ..., 1. Again, the sum of the first 31 terms is not zero, so this AP does not satisfy the condition given in the question.

An AP centered around zero: Let's say the AP is -15, -14, -13, ..., 0, ..., 13, 14, 15. In this case, the sum of the first 31 terms is zero, so this AP satisfies the condition given in the question. The 31st smallest term is 15, the 16th largest term is -1, and the sum of the largest and smallest terms is zero. So, none of the statements I, II, and III are true in this case."

The hypothesis we're trying to strengthen is that Codex Berinensis was produced in 1148. The evidence for this hypothesis is that a letter written by the fourth copyist mentions a plague that occurred in Florence in 1148.

Option (B) tells us that according to the fourth copyist, the plague went on for 10 months. While this is additional information about the plague, it doesn't actually strengthen the hypothesis that Codex Berinensis was produced in 1148. Whether the plague lasted for 10 months or 10 days doesn't make it more likely that the Codex was produced in the year of the plague. The duration of the plague is unrelated to the timing of the production of the Codex.

On the other hand, option (D) tells us that there was only one outbreak of plague in Florence in the 1100s. If this is true, and we know from the fourth copyist's letter that there was a plague in Florence in 1148, then it must be the case that the plague the fourth copyist is referring to is the 1148 plague. This makes it more likely that the Codex was produced in 1148, because we know that the fourth copyist was writing at the time of the plague.

The key here is to focus on the specific hypothesis you're trying to strengthen: that Codex Berinensis was produced in 1148. Each answer choice should be evaluated based on whether it provides additional support for that specific hypothesis. 

In terms of avoiding this kind of error in the future, it's important to clearly understand the hypothesis and the evidence supporting it before evaluating the answer choices. Then, for each answer choice, ask yourself: does this provide additional support for the hypothesis? If it doesn't, then it's not the correct answer, even if it provides interesting or relevant information. 

In this case, option (B) might have seemed attractive because it provides additional information about the plague, which is part of the evidence for the hypothesis. But it's not correct."

It's great that you were able to eliminate options A, C, and E correctly. Now, let's focus on your confusion between options B and D.

The phrases &quot;that cannot be foreseen&quot; and &quot;that are not foreseeable&quot; essentially mean the same thing. However, the difference lies in their style and conciseness.

Option B: &quot;that cannot be foreseen&quot; - This is a more direct and concise way of expressing the idea. It's straightforward and to the point, which is generally preferred in English, especially in formal writing like on the GMAT.

Option D: &quot;that are not foreseeable&quot; - This is a more roundabout way of saying the same thing. The phrase &quot;are not foreseeable&quot; is a bit wordier and less direct than &quot;cannot be foreseen&quot;.

In English, especially in a test like the GMAT, conciseness is valued. If you can say the same thing in fewer words, that's usually the better option. That's why option B is preferred over option D.

It's also worth noting that &quot;cannot be foreseen&quot; is a more common and idiomatic way of expressing this idea than &quot;are not foreseeable&quot;. In the GMAT, as well as in other standardized tests, choosing the more idiomatic expression is often the right call.

So, even though both options are grammatically correct and they both make sense in the context of the sentence, option B is the better choice because it's more concise and idiomatic.

In the future, when you're stuck between two options that both seem correct, try to look for differences in style and conciseness. Ask yourself: Which option is more direct? Which one is more concise? Which one sounds more natural or idiomatic in English? This can often help you choose the right answer."

CR,Correct,C,C,650-700,Weaken,"ChatGPT:
Let's break down the reasoning for why option A (which you chose) is incorrect and option C (the correct answer) is better.

The biographers' claim is: Tocqueville disliked centralized government because he blamed Napoleon's rule for the poverty of his childhood in Normandy.

Our task is to cast doubt on this claim, which means we need to weaken the idea that Tocqueville's dislike for centralized government was due to him blaming Napoleon for his childhood poverty.

Option A states: &quot;Although Napoleon was popularly blamed at the time for the terrible living conditions in Normandy, historians now know that bad harvests were really to blame for the poor economic conditions.&quot;

Option A provides information that Napoleon was not the actual cause of the poor economic conditions in Normandy; instead, bad harvests were to blame. However, this option does not directly address Tocqueville's belief about who or what was responsible for his childhood poverty. It is still possible that Tocqueville blamed Napoleon despite the historians' updated knowledge. Thus, option A does not effectively weaken the biographers' claim.

Option C states: &quot;Tocqueville said he knew that if his father had not suffered ill health, his family would have had a steady income and a comfortable standard of living.&quot;

Option C directly addresses Tocqueville's belief about the cause of his childhood poverty. It shows that Tocqueville attributed his childhood poverty to his father's ill health, not to Napoleon's rule. By providing an alternative reason for Tocqueville's childhood poverty, option C breaks the causal link between Tocqueville's dislike of centralized government and his blaming Napoleon for his poverty. This directly weakens the biographers' claim, making option C the better answer choice."

PS,Incorrect,A,D,700-750,"Divisibility/Multiples/Factors, Number Properties","Let's break it down further.

1. **Understanding the problem:** We're given a number 'n' which ends in 1680. If we remove the last four digits (1680), we're left with a number 'k'. We're asked to find how many different values of 'n' there are such that the ratio of 'n' to 'k' is an integer.

2. **Expressing 'n' in terms of 'k':** Since 'n' ends in 1680, we can express 'n' as '10000k + 1680'. Why? Because 'k' is the number we get when we remove the last four digits from 'n', and '10000k' gives us a number where the last four digits are zeros. Adding 1680 to this gives us a number where the last four digits are 1680.

3. **Finding the condition for 'n/k' to be an integer:** We're told that 'n/k' is an integer. If we substitute our expression for 'n' into this, we get '(10000k + 1680) / k' is an integer. Simplifying this, we get '10000 + 1680/k'. For this to be an integer, '1680/k' must also be an integer.

4. **Finding the factors of 1680:** The problem now reduces to finding how many values 'k' can take such that '1680/k' is an integer. This is equivalent to finding how many factors 1680 has. To do this, we first find the prime factorization of 1680, which is '2^4 * 3 * 5 * 7'.

5. **Counting the factors of 1680:** The number of factors of a number is given by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization. So, the number of factors of 1680 is '(4+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)' = '5*2*2*2' = 40.

So, there are 40 different values of 'n' such that 'n/k' is an integer. The answer is (D) 40.

RC,Correct,A,A,700,"Business, Short Passage","I understand that the language of the answer choices can be a bit complex. Let's break down each option:

(A) well founded though incomplete: This means that the theory is based on sound principles or evidence, but it doesn't cover all aspects of the situation.

(B) difficult to articulate: This means that the theory is hard to express or explain in words.

(C) plausible but poorly substantiated: This means that the theory seems reasonable or probable, but it lacks supporting evidence or details.

(D) seriously flawed: This means that the theory has significant mistakes or problems.

(E) contrary to recent research: This means that the theory goes against or disagrees with the findings of recent studies or investigations.

Now, let's consider the author's view on the human capital theory based on the passage. The author acknowledges the usefulness of the human capital theory in explaining why women were concentrated in certain low-skill jobs in the seventeenth-century Florentine textile industry. However, the author also points out that the theory doesn't fully explain the differences in pay scales between different low-skill jobs.

So, the author seems to view the human capital theory as a useful tool for understanding the labor market of the time, but also sees it as not providing a complete picture, especially when it comes to wage differences. Therefore, the best answer choice would be (A) well founded though incomplete."
RC,Incorrect,E,A,700,"Business, Short Passage","I apologize for the confusion. Let's revisit option (A):

(A) Women were unlikely to work outside the home even in occupations whose hours were flexible enough to allow women to accommodate domestic tasks as well as paid labor.

The human capital theory posits that women chose occupations that could be carried out in the home due to their primary responsibility in child rearing. If women were unlikely to work outside the home even when the jobs had flexible hours, it suggests that factors other than the ability to balance work and child-rearing responsibilities were influencing women's occupational choices. This indeed weakens the human capital theory's explanation for why women were concentrated in certain occupations.

So, you're correct. Option (A) is the correct answer. It weakens the human capital theory by suggesting that even when jobs allowed for the balance of work and child-rearing, women still preferred to work from home. This implies that there might be other factors at play influencing women's occupational choices, not just the need to balance work and child-rearing responsibilities.

Benchmarking is when a company looks at what other companies are doing to see if there are any practices or strategies that they could adopt to improve their own performance. It's like comparing your test scores with the top student in the class to see where you can improve.

Now, the question is saying that instead of comparing with direct competitors (companies in the same industry selling similar products), it might be beneficial to compare with companies in different industries.

The question then asks for the statement that is NOT a valid reason for doing this. In other words, all the options are reasons why a company might want to benchmark against non-competitors, except for one. We need to find that one.

Let's reword the options to make them simpler:

(A) If we compare with competitors, we might just focus on things we're already doing.

(B) It's hard to get detailed information about what competitors are doing.

(C) Companies in the same industry are likely to be similarly efficient, so comparing with them might not give us new ideas to get ahead.

(D) Managers are more open to new ideas from outside their industry.

(E) Successful companies often use strategies that are specific to their product or market.

A. Incorrect. The use of &quot;must&quot; is incorrect here. The verb &quot;recommend&quot; is often followed by a subjunctive verb, which should be in the base form. So &quot;be kept&quot; would be correct, not &quot;must be kept.&quot;

B. Incorrect. As you pointed out, the use of &quot;was&quot; is incorrect. We need &quot;were&quot; for the subjunctive mood. Also, &quot;should be kept&quot; is incorrect. We need &quot;be kept.&quot;

D. Correct. This sentence correctly uses &quot;were&quot; in the if-clause and the base form of the verb &quot;be&quot; in the result clause.

E. Incorrect. The verb tense &quot;would have been&quot; is incorrect in the if-clause. We need &quot;were.&quot; Also, &quot;would be kept&quot; is incorrect. We need &quot;be kept.&quot;

Non-count nouns are words for things that are not usually counted, often because they represent abstract ideas or concepts that are typically thought of as a whole rather than as individual items.

In English, non-count nouns are treated as singular for the purposes of verb agreement. That means we use singular verbs with them. So, we say &quot;the information is&quot; not &quot;the information are&quot;.

In the sentence you provided, &quot;all of the information&quot; is treated as a singular entity, which is why the verb &quot;is&quot; is used.

It's important to note that while &quot;information&quot; can sometimes be used to refer to multiple pieces of information, it is still treated as a singular noun in terms of grammar. For example, we would say &quot;I have a lot of information&quot; not &quot;I have many informations&quot;.

So, in the context of the sentence you provided, &quot;information&quot; is singular because it's a non-count noun and is therefore paired with the singular verb &quot;is&quot;."

Now, let's apply the step-by-step approach to each answer choice:

A) By skimming along the top of the atmosphere, a proposed new style of aircraft could fly between most points on Earth in under two hours, according to its proponents.

This is the original sentence. The modifier &quot;By skimming along the top of the atmosphere&quot; correctly modifies &quot;a proposed new style of aircraft&quot;. The pronoun &quot;its&quot; correctly refers to &quot;a proposed new style of aircraft&quot;. The meaning is clear. There are no grammatical errors.


E) According to its proponents, skimming along the top of the atmosphere makes it possible that a proposed new style of aircraft could fly between most points on Earth in under two hours.

In this sentence, &quot;skimming along the top of the atmosphere&quot; is incorrectly used as the subject of the sentence. The sentence suggests that the act of skimming along the top of the atmosphere is what makes it possible for the aircraft to fly, which changes the meaning of the original sentence.

In probability theory, two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur. In other words, the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other.
So, to clarify, when we say two events are mutually exclusive, it means that if one event happens, the other cannot.
Suppose you roll a single six-sided die. The events &quot;roll an even number&quot; and &quot;roll a 3&quot; are mutually exclusive. Why? Because if you roll an even number, you definitely did not roll a 3, and if you roll a 3, you definitely did not roll an even number.


x+y+z = 1

Since the ratio is given,

x:y:z can be written as: 
We can multiply with a constant (k)
so, 4k + 2k + k = 1
therefore, k = 1/7
So, we can find x. (4/7)

Statement 1 is sufficient.

For the second equation:
x^2 + xy + xz - x-y-z = -3/7
=&gt; x(x+y+z) -1(x+y+z) = -3/7

The use of the present participle &quot;protecting&quot; in option C is not to indicate the present tense. Instead, it's used as a modifier to describe the function of the &quot;animal-hide shields with wooden frames&quot;.

In English, we often use the present participle (verb-ing form) as an adjective to describe the noun. For example, in the sentence &quot;The running water was cold&quot;, &quot;running&quot; is a present participle used as an adjective to describe the water. It doesn't mean the water is running in the present time.

Similarly, in option C, &quot;protecting&quot; is used as a modifier to describe what the shields were doing, not to indicate the time of the action.

On the other hand, option E uses &quot;to protect&quot; which changes the meaning of the sentence. The infinitive &quot;to protect&quot; implies purpose or intention, suggesting that the shields were essential items of military equipment for the purpose of protecting warriors. But the original sentence doesn't convey a purpose; it simply states that the shields had a protective function.

So, between C and E, C is the better choice because it maintains the original meaning of the sentence and uses the present participle correctly as a modifier."

Now, let's discuss why option E is incorrect.

This choice is incorrect because it breaks parallelism in the comparison. The first part of the comparison is &quot;what the United States exported&quot;, which is an action. However, the second part of the comparison is &quot;the Japanese exports&quot;, which is a noun phrase, not an action.

In a parallel structure, the items being compared need to be of the same type. Here, we're comparing the action of the European Economic Community exporting goods to two other actions: the United States exporting goods and Japan exporting goods.

Moreover, this approach doesn't account for the fact that we're picking without replacement, which means the probabilities change each time we pick a number.

Lastly, this approach doesn't ensure that both 10 and 20 are picked in the five tries, which is what the question is asking for.

So, while your thinking is on the right track, the execution isn't quite correct for this problem. The correct approach would be to use combinations to calculate the total number of ways to pick five numbers, and the number of ways to pick five numbers that include both 10 and 20.

First, we need to calculate the total number of ways to select five numbers from 20. This is a combination problem, and we can use the formula for combinations to solve it: nCr = n! / [(n-r)!r!]. In this case, n is 20 and r is 5.

Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to select five numbers that include both 10 and 20. Since we know that 10 and 20 are included, we actually only need to choose three more numbers. The remaining numbers can be any of the 18 numbers that aren't 10 or 20, so n is 18 and r is 3.

The probability that the five numbers will include both 10 and 20 is then the number of ways to select five numbers that include both 10 and 20 divided by the total number of ways to select five numbers from 20.

Let's calculate these values:

Total number of ways to select five numbers from 20: 20C5 = 15504
Number of ways to select five numbers that include both 10 and 20: 18C3 = 816

So, the probability is 816 / 15504 = 0.0526, which is closest to 1/19, so the answer is B."

Break Down the Problem: Instead of trying to understand the problem all at once, break it down into smaller parts. Understand each part before moving on to the next. This will help you avoid confusion and will make it easier to keep track of the details.

Write Down What You Know: As you read the problem, write down the information you're given and what you're trying to find. This will help you keep track of the details and will give you a reference point if you get lost.

Double Check Your Understanding: After you've read the problem and before you start solving, take a moment to double check your understanding. Make sure you know what you're being asked to find and that you've correctly understood the information you're given.

Practice: The more problems you solve, the better you'll get at keeping track of the details. Practice with a variety of problems so you get comfortable with different types of questions.

Remember, even the best test-takers can make mistakes. The key is to learn from your mistakes and to keep practicing and improving."

PS,Correct,E,E,500-600,Probability,"The question asks for the probability that one of the two pieces of fruit selected will be an apple and the other will be an orange. This can happen in two ways:

The apple is selected from the first basket and the orange is selected from the second basket.
The orange is selected from the first basket and the apple is selected from the second basket.

Let's break it down:

The probability of selecting an apple from the first basket is 4/6 (because there are 4 apples out of 6 total fruits). The probability of selecting an orange from the second basket is 5/8 (because there are 5 oranges out of 8 total fruits). So, the probability of both these events happening is (4/6) * (5/8) = 20/48 = 5/12.

The probability of selecting an orange from the first basket is 2/6 (because there are 2 oranges out of 6 total fruits). The probability of selecting an apple from the second basket is 3/8 (because there are 3 apples out of 8 total fruits). So, the probability of both these events happening is (2/6) * (3/8) = 6/48 = 1/8.

Since these are mutually exclusive events (they can't both happen at the same time), you can add the probabilities together to get the total probability:

5/12 + 1/8 = 8/24 + 3/24 = 11/24.

So, the probability that one of the two pieces of fruit selected will be an apple and the other will be an orange is 11/24.

The key to solving this problem quickly is to clearly identify the separate events (selecting from the first basket and selecting from the second basket), calculate the probabilities for each event, and then combine them correctly."
PS,Correct,C,C,600-650,Probability,"The key to this problem is understanding the phrase &quot;events M and R cannot both occur&quot;. This means that M and R are mutually exclusive events.

Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. In other words, the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other.

In probability, for two mutually exclusive events, the probability that either of the events will occur is the sum of their individual probabilities.

So, the probability that either M or R will occur is simply the sum of the probability that M will occur and the probability that R will occur.

You correctly calculated the probability that M will occur as 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (or 1/5 in fraction form) and the probability that R will occur as 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 (or 2/5 in fraction form).

So, the probability that either M or R will occur is 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3/5.

You got stuck because you were probably thinking about the concept of independent events, where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. In this case, we are dealing with mutually exclusive events, not independent events. The key is to carefully read the problem and identify the type of events you are dealing with."
PS,Correct,A,A,500-600,Probability,"Yes, you are absolutely correct in your approach and your answer. The probability is indeed 2/5.

Let's clarify a few concepts:

Counting: In the problem, we are asked to count the numbers from 101 through 350. This is a total of 350 - 101 + 1 = 250 numbers. The &quot;+1&quot; is because both 101 and 350 are included in the count. This is a common mistake that people make when counting - they forget to include the last number. Always remember that when you are counting a range of numbers, you need to add 1 to include both ends of the range.

Probability: Probability is a measure of the likelihood of a particular event occurring. It is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. In this problem, the favorable outcomes are the numbers with a hundreds digit of 2, and the total outcomes are all the numbers from 101 through 350.

Digits: In a number, the hundreds digit is the digit in the hundreds place. For example, in the number 234, the hundreds digit is 2. In this problem, we are looking for numbers where the hundreds digit is 2, which are the numbers from 200 through 299.

So, in summary, your approach is correct and your understanding of the concepts seems to be solid. Well done!"
PS,Correct,C,C,500-600,Probability,"Your reasoning is correct!

The key here is to understand that the events are dependent, meaning the outcome of the first event (the first pen being non-defective) affects the outcome of the second event (the second pen being non-defective).

When the first pen is selected and it's non-defective, it's removed from the box, so there are now 11 pens left in the box, 8 of which are non-defective. So, the probability that the second pen is non-defective is indeed 8/11.

Therefore, the probability that both pens are non-defective is (9/12) * (8/11) = 6/11.

So, your answer is correct, and the correct choice is (C) 6/11.


Method- 2
There are 9 fine pieces of pen and 3 defective in a lot of 12 pens

No. of ways of choosing 2 NON defective out of 9 fine pieces of pen = 9C2
No. of ways of choosing 2 out of 12 pieces of pen = 12C2

Required probability that none of the chosen is defective = 9C2 / 12C2 = 36 / 66 = 6/11


Permutations and combinations are both ways to count the number of possible arrangements or selections of items. The key difference between them is whether or not the order of the items matters.

Permutations: If the order of the items matters, then you use permutations. For example, if you are trying to figure out the number of ways you can arrange 3 books on a shelf, the order in which the books are arranged matters, so you would use permutations.

The formula for permutations is: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!

This formula gives you the number of ways to arrange r items out of a total of n items.

Combinations: If the order of the items does not matter, then you use combinations. For example, if you are trying to figure out the number of ways you can select 3 books from a pile of 10, the order in which you select the books doesn't matter, so you would use combinations.

The formula for combinations is: C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!]

This formula gives you the number of ways to select r items out of a total of n items, without regard to the order of selection."

They connect the dependent clause to the antecedent (the noun that the relative pronoun refers to).
It's great that you're reflecting on your thought process. That's a key part of improving.

Your confusion between options C and E seems to stem from a misunderstanding of how the relative pronoun &quot;that&quot; and the participle &quot;resembling&quot; are used in these sentences.

In option C, the use of &quot;that&quot; twice makes the sentence awkward and unnecessarily complex. The second &quot;that&quot; is followed by a comma and &quot;resembling silkworms&quot;, which is a bit confusing. It's not immediately clear what &quot;that&quot; is referring to, and the comma makes it seem like &quot;resembling silkworms&quot; is an additional piece of information about the previous &quot;that&quot;, not about the mopane worm.

In option E, the phrase &quot;consumed by millions of Africans and that, resembling silkworms&quot; is also unclear. Again, it's not immediately clear what &quot;that&quot; is referring to, and the phrase &quot;resembling silkworms&quot; seems to be modifying &quot;that&quot; rather than the mopane worm.

In contrast, option B is clear and concise. The phrase &quot;consumed by millions of Africans and resembling silkworms&quot; clearly modifies &quot;the mopane worm&quot;. There's no confusion about what is being consumed or what resembles silkworms.

To avoid this kind of error in the future, pay close attention to what each word or phrase in the sentence is referring to or modifying. If a sentence is unclear or confusing, it's probably not the best choice. Also, remember that the GMAT prefers answers that are clear and concise. If you're stuck between two options, the simpler one is usually the better choice."

The problem with this option is that it subtly changes the meaning of the sentence. The original sentence is talking about the proportion of energy that &quot;derives from&quot; nuclear power. This means that nuclear power is the source of that energy.

However, in option D, the phrase &quot;comes from&quot; could be interpreted in a different way. It could mean that the energy already exists, and it's simply being sourced or obtained from nuclear power. This is a subtle difference, but it's important because it changes the meaning of the sentence.

Here are some similar examples:

Original: &quot;Most of the revenue of the company derives from its software products.&quot;
Incorrect: &quot;Most of the revenue of the company comes from its software products.&quot;
The original sentence implies that the software products are the source of the revenue. The incorrect sentence could be interpreted to mean that the revenue already exists, and it's simply being obtained from the software products.

DS,Incorrect,E,A,650-700,Divisibility/Multiples/Factors,"That's a great observation! You're on the right track.

The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8 is indeed 24. This means that any number that is a multiple of both 6 and 8 is also a multiple of 24.

In this problem, we already know that the product of any three consecutive integers (b in this case) is a multiple of 6.

Statement (1) tells us that b is also a multiple of 8.

So, if b is a multiple of both 6 and 8, it must be a multiple of 24.

Therefore, statement (1) is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's move on to statement (2).

Statement (2) tells us that c is odd.

Remember, we need b to have at least three 2's in its prime factorization to be a multiple of 24.

If c is odd, then c+1 is even, and c+2 is odd again.

The only even number in the product (c, c+1, c+2) is c+1.

An even number has at least one 2 in its prime factorization, but we need at least three 2's for b to be a multiple of 24.

Therefore, knowing that c is odd does not guarantee that b is a multiple of 24.

So, statement (2) is not sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is (A): Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.

You're correct that the items in our problem are not all the same. We have two types of books: paperbacks and hardbacks. This adds a layer of complexity to the problem, but the concept of combinations still applies.

When we select 5 books, we need to consider the different ways we can split those 5 books between paperbacks and hardbacks. For example, we could have:

1 paperback and 4 hardbacks
2 paperbacks and 3 hardbacks
3 paperbacks and 2 hardbacks
4 paperbacks and 1 hardback
For each of these scenarios, we'll calculate the number of combinations separately for paperbacks and hardbacks, and then multiply the results together. This is because the choice of paperbacks and the choice of hardbacks are independent events.

For example, if we're considering the scenario with 1 paperback and 4 hardbacks, we would calculate:

The number of ways to choose 1 paperback from 4: C(4, 1)
The number of ways to choose 4 hardbacks from 6: C(6, 4)
We would then multiply these two results together to get the total number of ways to select 5 books with 1 paperback and 4 hardbacks.

We would repeat this process for each scenario, and then add up all the results to get the total number of possible selections.

PS,Incorrect,D,E,600-650,Combinations,"This question is testing your understanding of permutations, which is a concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting, arrangement, and combination.

A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is given by the formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this question, we are asked to find the ratio of the number of 5-letter code words to the number of 4-letter code words.

The number of 5-letter code words can be found by using the permutation formula P(10, 5) = 10! / (10-5)! = 109876 = 30,240.

Similarly, the number of 4-letter code words is P(10, 4) = 10! / (10-4)! = 1098*7 = 5,040.

So, the ratio of the number of 5-letter code words to the number of 4-letter code words is 30,240 / 5,040 = 6 to 1.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 6 to 1.

To improve your thought process for these types of problems, it's important to understand the concept of permutations and how to apply the formula.

The sentence is comparing the country's apparent affluence (a situation) to a Hollywood movie set with nothing behind the building fronts (another situation). The comparison is not just between the nouns &quot;affluence&quot; and &quot;movie set&quot;, but between the entire situations these nouns represent.

Therefore, option (C) &quot;As though&quot; is the correct answer.

Option (D) &quot;Like&quot; is incorrect because &quot;like&quot; should be followed by a noun or a noun phrase, not a clause. In the sentence, &quot;like&quot; is followed by &quot;a Hollywood movie set with nothing behind the building fronts&quot;, which is a clause, not a noun phrase.

I hope this clarifies the confusion. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
SC,Correct,E,E,700-750,Idioms/Diction/Redundancy,"The key difference between options A and E lies in the use of &quot;until&quot; versus &quot;as long as&quot;.

Option A: &quot;The sale of government surplus machinery will begin at 9 a.m. and continue until the supply lasts.&quot;

Option E: &quot;The sale of government surplus machinery will begin at 9 a.m. and will continue as long as the supply lasts.&quot;

In this context, &quot;until&quot; suggests that the sale will stop when the supply is still available, which is not the intended meaning. On the other hand, &quot;as long as&quot; correctly conveys that the sale will continue for the duration that the supply is available, and will stop when the supply is exhausted.

Therefore, option E is the correct answer as it accurately and logically conveys the intended meaning.

The phrase &quot;Hurry, offer valid until stocks last&quot; is actually commonly used in advertising and is generally understood in everyday English. However, if we apply the same logic we used in the GMAT question, a more precise way to express this would be &quot;Hurry, offer valid as long as stocks last.&quot;

This is because &quot;as long as&quot; more accurately conveys the condition under which the offer is valid - that is, the offer is valid for the duration that the stocks last.

&quot;Until stocks last&quot; could be interpreted as the offer being valid up to the point just before the stocks last, which is likely not the intended meaning.

However, it's important to note that language usage can vary between formal test situations like the GMAT and everyday English, especially in advertising language which often prioritizes catchy phrasing over grammatical precision."

Let's consider an example. Let's say d2 is 10 feet and r2 is 10 feet per second. According to the statements, d1 would be 40 feet and r1 would be 40 feet per second. If you calculate the time, you'll find that both times are exactly 1 second.

Now, let's consider another example. Let's say d2 is 60 feet and r2 is 30 feet per second. According to the statements, d1 would be 90 feet and r1 would be 60 feet per second. If you calculate the time, you'll find that the time for d1/r1 is 1.5 seconds and the time for d2/r2 is 2 seconds. In this case, d1/r1 is less than d2/r2.

So, as you can see, even with both statements, we can't definitively determine whether d1/r1 is greater than d2/r2. It depends on the actual values of d1, d2, r1, and r2.

The key takeaway here is to remember that when dealing with ratios or rates, an increase in both the numerator and denominator doesn't necessarily result in an increase in the value of the fraction. Always consider the relationship between the quantities and avoid making assumptions.

To avoid such errors in the future, I would recommend practicing more problems involving ratios and rates, and always test your assumptions with different sets of values."

Self-esteem refers to an individual's overall sense of their value or worth. It's a judgment of oneself as well as an attitude toward oneself. Generally, individuals with high self-esteem tend to have a more positive self-perception, meaning they're more likely to think highly of their abilities. This can lead to overestimation of their skills because their high self-esteem creates a positive bias in their self-assessment. They feel good about themselves, and this confidence extends to their perception of their own skills.

On the other hand, underestimation is less likely in individuals with high self-esteem. Underestimating one's skills is more commonly associated with low self-esteem, where individuals tend to have a negative perception of their abilities. This doesn't align with the characteristics of individuals with high self-esteem, who tend to be confident in their abilities.

While it's technically possible that someone with high self-esteem could underestimate their abilities, it's less common and doesn't align with the general behavior associated with high self-esteem. Therefore, in the context of the argument and the behavior typically associated with high self-esteem, &quot;less accurate perception&quot; is more likely to suggest overestimation rather than underestimation.

As you study more about the topic of self-esteem, you will get more familiar with these patterns and psychological correlations. It's great that you're asking these questions and deepening your understanding, as this kind of critical thinking will be beneficial in answering similar GMAT questions in the future."

The argument states that emergency response workers prefer hydraulic tools for two reasons. One reason is already provided ??? the tools are less frightening to crash victims. We're then asked to identify a second reason that complements the existing one and stays within the context of the argument.

Option E, the one you chose, talks about the leverage offered by hydraulic tools. While this could potentially be a reason why workers might prefer hydraulic tools, it doesn't fit into the context of the argument very well. The argument mainly focuses on the safety and effectiveness of the tools in emergency scenarios, not on their ease of use.

On the other hand, option C provides a reason that is more aligned with the argument. It states that hydraulic tools are less likely to worsen an already dangerous situation, which complements the first reason given in the argument (hydraulic tools are less frightening) and stays within the context of safety and effectiveness in emergencies.

In terms of improving your thought process, here are some tips:

Understand the argument: Make sure you fully understand what the argument is saying and what the question is asking. Each part of the argument and each word in the question stem can provide important clues.

Look for direct impact: The correct answer choice will directly weaken the conclusion. It should contradict or challenge the main claim, not just introduce new or tangentially related information.

Option (D) weakens this argument by introducing information about a different year ??? 1970. This option tells us that in 1970, two of the countries had a much larger share and two had a much smaller share of total world exports than they did in 1984. This information suggests that there was significant fluctuation in the share of world exports for these countries between 1953, 1970, and 1984. In other words, these countries' shares weren't as steady or stable as they appeared to be when only comparing 1953 to 1984. This fluctuation conflicts with the argument's suggestion that these countries can serve as models of stability.

As for Option (E), the range of exports as a percentage of national output doesn't necessarily indicate instability in the share of global exports. A country could consistently export 75% of its national output, for example, and this could represent a stable share of global exports. So, while this fact might have implications for domestic economic policies or production capabilities, it doesn't directly contradict the idea that these countries have maintained a stable share of global exports.

The argument states that the four countries had the same share of world exports in 1984 as in 1953. In other words, they maintained a steady proportion of global trade over this period of 31 years. It's this stability that is proposed as a model for other countries."

DS,Correct,D,D,650-700,Geometry,"Before we go any further, it's helpful to understand that the total partition length would be least if all the gardens were in a straight line along one of the lot's dimensions. This would mean the partition would be running along the other dimension. Therefore, our goal should be to try and fit the gardens along the width (80ft) or the length (120ft) to minimize the partition length.

Now let's consider the statements:

(1) One of the dimensions of each garden is to be 40 feet.
If one dimension is 40 feet, there are two possibilities for the gardens:

They can be 3 along the length (120ft) and the other dimension would have to be 80/3 = 26.67 feet (approx), but it's not an integer and so not possible.
They can be 2 along the width (80ft) and the other dimension would have to be 120/5 = 24 feet. This fits and gives a total partitioning of 5 * 80 = 400 feet. This statement is sufficient.
(2) One of the dimensions of each garden is to be 24 feet.
Again, there are two possibilities for the gardens:

They can be 5 along the length (120ft) and the other dimension would be 80/2 = 40 feet. This gives a total partitioning of 2 * 120 = 240 feet.
They can be 10 along the width (80ft) but then the other dimension would be 120/10 = 12 feet. This doesn't match the given dimension of 24 feet. This statement is sufficient as well.
Since both statements are individually sufficient, the answer is (D).

Key takeaways:

Whenever you see problems like this, always try to minimize the partitioning (or maximize, depending on the question) by trying to fit the partitions along one dimension.

SC,Incorrect,A,B,500-600,"Verb Tense/Form, Parallelism","Certainly, I can understand how this can be confusing at first glance.

In English, when we're discussing future events that are certain to happen or follow a scheduled or regular pattern, we tend to use the present simple tense after conjunctions of time like &quot;when&quot;, &quot;as soon as&quot;, &quot;until&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, etc., even though the overall tense of the sentence is future.

In your sentence, &quot;The city will lose more than one million dollars&quot; is the main clause and refers to a future event, but the time-dependent clause starting with &quot;when&quot; does not use the future tense. Instead, it uses the present simple to refer to the future event. This is a standard rule in English grammar.

So, in the clause &quot;when the shopping center on Beacon Drive will close sometime in the next year and move to a different county&quot;, &quot;will close&quot; and &quot;move&quot; should actually be &quot;closes&quot; and &quot;moves&quot;.

This is a rule that can take a bit of practice to get used to. Just remember, if you're using &quot;when&quot; to talk about the future, you should generally stick with the present simple in that subordinate clause. The &quot;future&quot; part is already implied by the main clause.

Option B correctly uses &quot;closes&quot; and &quot;moves&quot; and thus maintains grammatical consistency and conveys the correct meaning: &quot;The city will lose more than one million dollars in much-needed revenue when the shopping center on Beacon Drive closes sometime in the next year and moves to a different county.&quot;"

(E) directly supports the Head of Billing's position by offering a plausible reason why the Billing department's expenditure on supplies is higher: members of the Accounting department have been using supplies from the Billing department's cabinet, resulting in a higher charge to the Billing department's budget.

Option (C), on the other hand, while it might explain an increase in expenditure, it doesn't necessarily strengthen the Head of Billing's claim that there is no waste happening. An increased variety of supplies might or might not lead to increased expenditure, depending on the cost of these supplies. However, it doesn't directly deal with the issue of waste.

When approaching strengthen questions, it's crucial to select the answer choice that most directly and positively impacts the argument or claim in question. In this case, answer choice (E) gives a direct reason why the Billing department's expenditure would be higher without any implication of waste, hence strengthening the Head of Billing's claim."

So why else is option E incorrect, even though it uses parallel structure? The GMAT requires the use of the serial comma (aka the Oxford comma) for every item in a list, including the last item in a list of 3+ items. Answer E doesn???t use a serial comma for the third item, so it???s wrong.

The Oxford comma, also known as the serial comma, is used in a list of three or more items, before the conjunction (usually 'and' or 'or'). Its main purpose is to clarify the meaning of sentences that list multiple items to avoid potential ambiguity or misunderstanding.

For example, consider the following sentence:

&quot;I love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty.&quot;

Without the Oxford comma, this sentence could be interpreted as stating that the speaker's parents are Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty. This is obviously not the intended meaning.

Now, let's add the Oxford comma:

&quot;I love my parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty.&quot;

With the Oxford comma, the sentence clearly states that the speaker loves three separate entities: their parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty.

In the context of GMAT, it's important to use the Oxford comma to ensure clarity and precision in your writing. While in everyday writing, the usage of the Oxford comma can sometimes be a matter of style and preference, in the GMAT it's a requirement in sentences with lists of three or more items. This is because the GMAT emphasizes clear and unambiguous communication.

Here is an example of a sentence adhering to GMAT standards:

&quot;The company specializes in developing, manufacturing, and distributing electronic devices.&quot;

In this sentence, the Oxford comma is used before the conjunction 'and', clearly indicating the three distinct activities the company specializes in."

In the mid-nineteenth century, life expectancy in North America was 40 years.
Now, life expectancy in North America is nearly 80 years.
Conclusion:
In the mid-nineteenth century, people must have been considered old at an age that we now consider the prime of life.

The question stem asks you to find the statement that, if true, undermines the argument above.

The argument assumes that because the life expectancy was lower in the mid-nineteenth century, people must have been considered old at an age that we now consider the prime of life. The argument is based on the comparison of life expectancies between two different time periods.

The correct answer is (B). Here are explanations for all the answer choices:

(A) The population size in the mid-nineteenth century doesn't have a direct impact on whether people were considered old at a younger age. This doesn't undermine the argument.

(B) This statement undermines the argument because it suggests that the increase in life expectancy is primarily due to the reduction in infant mortality rather than people generally living longer. If most gains in life expectancy come from reducing infant deaths, then it's possible that people in the mid-nineteenth century lived to ages we consider the prime of life, but the overall life expectancy was lower because of high infant mortality rates.

(C) This statement doesn't undermine the argument, as it only explains one reason why people might live longer today. It doesn't address the perception of age in the mid-nineteenth century.

(D) This statement doesn't undermine the argument because it doesn't provide any information about the perception of age in the mid-nineteenth century.

(E) The of physical activity doesn't necessarily impact whether people were considered old at a younger age in the mid-nineteenth century. This statement doesn't undermine the argument."

The set property states: &quot;for any number t in the set, t + 2 is in the set.&quot; This means that if we know a number t is in the set, we can confidently say that t + 2 will also be in the set. However, we cannot make any conclusions about t - 2 being in the set based on this property alone.

In this specific problem, we are given that -1 is in the set. Using the set property, we know that -1 + 2 = 1 must be in the set. However, this property does not allow us to conclude that -1 - 2 = -3 must be in the set. We can only apply the property in the forward direction (t + 2), not the reverse direction (t - 2).

That's why your approach is incorrect, and statement I (-3) is not necessarily true based on the given set property.

Forget this question. Consider this:

If I go to the movies, my friend Disha must go with me. If Disha goes to the movies, Ari must go to the movies too.

So now what can you say if I tell you that I went to the movies?
You can say that Disha went too. And further, you can say that Ari went too.

What if I tell you Disha went to the movies? Does it mean I went too? If I go, Disha must go. But if Disha goes, is it necessary for me to go? No, she has no such hang ups. She can easily go with or without me. But if Disha goes, Ari must go too. So we can say that Ari went to the movies.

The question is very similar. If 't' is in the set, 't+2' must be in the set too. But is it essential for 't-2' to be in the set? No! Just like Disha doesn't need me, 't+2' doesn't need 't'. 't+2' needs only 't+4'.
If 't+2' is in the set, 't+4' must be picked too. If 't+4' is there, 't+6' must be there too and so on..."

We already know that AB has fulfilled the election commission's financial disclosure requirements. Even if there are other ways to fulfill those requirements, it still seems as though AB has taken the first step towards running for governor. The answer to choice (B) might provide interesting information, but it would not help us evaluate the journalists' argument or conclusion. Eliminate (B).

E. Had Bergeron also fulfilled the financial disclosure requirements for candidacy before any previous gubernatorial elections?

AB has taken a step that WOULD be necessary if he actually wanted to become a candidate. Based on that information, the journalist concludes that AB is very likely be a candidate for governor this year.

But what if AB has taken this same step before other previous gubernatorial elections? We know that AB has never run before, so if the answer to (E) is &quot;Yes,&quot; then AB has, in the past, completed this step without subsequently running for governor.

In other words, if the answer is &quot;Yes,&quot; then AB has a history of completing this step without actually running for governor. So, taking that step would not be evidence that AB is actually going to run. Since the journalist's argument is based solely on that piece of evidence, this would hurt the argument.

If, however, this is the first time that AB has taken this step, then it is stronger evidence that AB will actually run.

Answering this question would be much more useful than answering the question listed in choice (C), so (E) is the best answer.

Also:
Does he routinely fulfil financial disclosure requirements for candidacy before elections but chicken out later? If yes, then it is not likely that he will run this time. If he has never filed before, it looks like he is serious this time."

(A) the army of terra-cotta warriors created to protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife is more than 2,000 years old and took 700,000 artisans more than 36 years to complete

This sentence is clear, concise, and effectively communicates the information.
(B) Qin Shi huang, China's first emperor, was protected in his afterlife by an army of terracotta warriors that was created more than 2,000 years ago by 700,000 artisans who took more than 36 years to complete it

This sentence is wordy and shifts the focus from the army of terra-cotta warriors to Qin Shi Huang. The original sentence intended to emphasize the army's achievement.
(C) it took 700,000 artisans more than 36 years to create an army of terra-cotta warriors more than 2,000 years ago that would protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife

This sentence is wordy and awkwardly structured.
(D) more than 2,000 years ago, 700,000 artisans worked more than 36 years to create an army of terra-cotta warriors to protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife

This sentence changes the meaning by implying that the artisans worked for more than 36 years, rather than the project taking more than 36 years to complete.
(E) more than 36 years were needed to complete the army of terra-cotta warriors that 700,000 artisans created 2,000 years ago to protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife

This sentence is passive and wordy, making it less clear and concise than option (A).

Explanation: The passage's primary purpose is to explain the relationship between large reservoirs and the earthquakes they can induce, particularly through the example of the Nurek reservoir. The passage discusses how the mass of water in a reservoir and the underlying rock strata interact to cause seismic activity.

You chose option B, which suggests that the author is primarily concerned with resolving a dispute. While the passage does mention initial skepticism about reservoir-induced seismicity, the focus is not on resolving this dispute but on explaining the relationship between reservoirs and induced earthquakes."

You chose option C, which talks about the shale and gypsum layer beneath the permeable limestone basin in an anticline preventing water from penetrating deeper rock strata. This option actually describes the syncline region, not the anticline region, as mentioned in the passage: &quot;Any water entering one of the permeable layers could migrate to the bottom of the basin formed by that layer, but would be prevented from moving any further downward by the impermeable rock layer beneath.&quot;"

It's not uncommon to make errors while attempting GMAT questions, especially under time pressure. Your thought process in this question seems to have been influenced by the presence of the verb &quot;wrote&quot; and the feeling that there needed to be a similar verb structure for Haydn. However, the correct comparison in this case was between Schubert and Haydn themselves, not their actions.

Here are a few suggestions to help you avoid making similar errors in the future:

Stay focused on the core meaning and structure of the sentence: Keep the main idea and the intended comparison in mind while evaluating answer choices. In this case, the comparison is between Schubert and Haydn, not their actions.

Trust your understanding of grammar and sentence structure: If you have studied the topics and are familiar with the rules, trust your knowledge when you analyze answer choices. Don't let the presence of certain words or structures in the options distract you from applying your understanding of the underlying grammar.

Be mindful of conciseness and simplicity: The GMAT often rewards concise and simple expressions. In this question, option A is the most concise and clear option, while options B, C, D, and E introduce unnecessary complexity or redundancy.

Practice and review: The more you practice, the better you will become at identifying the correct answer choices and avoiding traps. After attempting questions, review your errors and try to understand the reasoning behind the correct answer choices. This will help reinforce your understanding and improve your decision-making during the test.

Stay confident and calm: Sometimes, test anxiety or a lack of confidence can lead to errors, even when you have a good understanding of the topics. Stay confident in your knowledge and maintain a calm and focused approach while attempting questions.

Remember, improvement takes time and practice."

Here are some steps to help you differentiate between verbs and modifiers, as well as to improve your overall approach to GMAT sentence correction questions:

Understand the difference between verbs and modifiers:
Verbs express actions or states and have subjects. They may change forms according to tense, person, and number.
Modifiers provide additional information about other words in a sentence. Adjectives modify nouns, while adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Participles (verb-ed and verb-ing forms) can also function as modifiers.
Carefully read the sentence and identify the subject and main verb to ensure proper subject-verb agreement. This will help you recognize the verbs in the sentence.

Look for parallelism in the sentence. Identify the elements that need to be parallel and make sure they maintain the same grammatical structure.

Slow down while reading the sentence and pay attention to the details. This will help you better understand the sentence structure and the roles of different words in the sentence.

Practice identifying verbs and modifiers in sentences. The more you practice, the better you will become at recognizing them.

When you encounter a GMAT question, first read the entire sentence carefully and try to understand its meaning. Then, look for any grammatical errors or issues with the sentence structure.

Focus on the differences between the answer choices, as they will often highlight the specific grammar rules being tested.

Eliminate answer choices that have clear errors or that change the intended meaning of the sentence.

Keep a log of the errors you make and the concepts you struggle with. Review this log regularly to ensure you are learning from your mistakes and to identify patterns in your errors.

As you practice, reflect on your thought process and how you approach each question. This will help you refine your strategy and become more efficient at identifying errors and choosing the correct answer."
CR,Incorrect,E,B,700-750,Weaken,"The argument states that the analysis attributing the upheaval in the office-equipment retail business to the advent of office equipment superstores is flawed, because the superstores have a small share of the retail market. To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that shows the superstores can still have a significant impact on the retail business, despite their small market share.

(A) This choice is irrelevant, as it discusses large customers who do not participate in the retail market.

(B) This choice weakens the argument by showing that the superstores' advertising of their low prices has forced prices down throughout the retail market, meaning they can still contribute to the upheaval in the retail business, regardless of their market share.

(C) This choice, although showing some superstores failing, does not address their impact on the retail business.

(D) This choice is irrelevant, as it discusses the ownership of the superstores, not their impact on the retail business.

(E) This choice is also irrelevant, as it discusses the changing nature of office equipment, not the impact of superstores on the retail business.

Test maker's psychology:
The test maker wants to assess your ability to identify relevant information and find a statement that directly weakens the argument.

Trap answers:
Trap answers might include irrelevant information, like options (A), (D), and (E), or information that does not directly address the argument's conclusion, like option (C).

Falling into traps:
Test takers can fall into these traps by failing to focus on the specific conclusion being made or by being distracted by irrelevant information.

ChatGPT: It's understandable that you might have found option (D) appealing, as it does provide a reason for the current high cost of satellites, i.e., the lack of economies of scale due to small production numbers. However, the question asks you to find the answer choice that best supports the conclusion that the cost of television satellites will continue to increase, not just explain the current high costs.

Option (D) does not give any information about future increases in costs. It only explains why the costs are currently high. The correct answer, (C), directly relates to the conclusion by stating that the greater the performance demands placed on satellites, the more frequently they break down, implying that future costs will continue to increase.

To rectify this error, focus on the specific conclusion the question asks you to support or weaken. In this case, it's about the future increase in costs, not just the current high costs. When evaluating answer choices, ask yourself if the information provided directly impacts the conclusion, and avoid choices that only explain the current situation without addressing the future changes.

Improving critical reasoning skills takes practice, so continue to work on similar questions and focus on understanding the nuances between answer choices. This will help you develop a better sense of what kind of information is needed to directly support or weaken a given conclusion."

Explanation for why (A) is correct:

The attempted explanation in the question posits that the selves of hypnotized subjects are dissociated into separate parts. One part is deaf, while another part replies. However, if the part that replies is not deaf and can hear the hypnotist, then logically, it should answer &quot;Yes&quot; instead of &quot;No&quot; when asked if it can hear the hypnotist. Option (A) points out this inconsistency and challenges the validity of the attempted explanation.

However, I could not understand the meaning of option A, and that's the reason I did not select it. Basically I got confused. How to rectify this thing?
ChatGPT: To rectify this confusion and improve your understanding of the answer choices, consider the following strategies:

Paraphrase the options: When you come across an answer choice that seems confusing or unclear, try to paraphrase it in your own words. This can help you clarify the meaning and better understand its relevance to the question.
For example, option A could be paraphrased as &quot;If the part of the subject that replies can hear the hypnotist, why doesn't it say 'Yes' instead of 'No' when asked if it can hear?&quot;

Refer back to the question stem: If you are unsure about an answer choice, go back to the question stem and reevaluate the given information. This can help you stay focused on the main argument or issue and determine whether the answer choice directly addresses it.

Slow down and re-read: Sometimes confusion arises from reading the answer choices too quickly or not paying close attention. Take a moment to slow down, re-read the confusing option, and ensure you understand its meaning before moving on."

ChatGPT:
It's good that you were able to eliminate options A, B, and D. Getting confused between C and E is understandable, as both options seem to provide some kind of logical ground. To avoid confusion and maintain context, follow these steps:

Re-read the question stem: Remind yourself of what the question is asking, which in this case, is to find the answer choice that does NOT provide a good logical ground for hospitals to object to the ranking system.

Compare the remaining options: Carefully consider how each remaining option relates to the main point of the question.

In this case:

Option C: It states that older patients are less likely to survive the same illnesses or procedures compared to younger patients. However, the data have already been adjusted for age differences, so this point does not provide a good logical ground for objecting to the ranking system.

Option E: It suggests that for-profit hospitals might not provide certain expensive services for very sick patients and refer them to other hospitals. This is a valid objection because it implies that the death rate may not accurately reflect the quality of care provided by these hospitals.

Re-evaluate based on the question requirement: Since the question is asking for the option that does NOT provide a good logical ground, Option C is the correct choice. Option E, although it seems to provide some kind of logical ground, is not what the question is asking for.
Remember to maintain focus on the specific requirement of the question and keep the context in mind."

Let me try to explain, and if I'm wrong, tell me where I am going wrong, and correct me.

So here, the parallelism is maintained between:
1) 'a lowering of interest rates and of fears about inflation,'
2) 'a rally in stocks and bonds'
and 
3) 'a weakening of the dollar'

ChatGPT:
Yes, you've got it right! The parallelism in the sentence is maintained between the three elements you listed:

'a lowering of interest rates and of fears about inflation,'
'a rally in stocks and bonds'
'a weakening of the dollar'
Each of these elements begins with an article 'a' followed by a noun and a description of the noun. This structure is consistent across all three elements, which makes them parallel. In the context of the sentence, it means that a large drop in oil prices should eventually lead to all three of these outcomes.

To avoid making mistakes with parallelism in the future, follow these steps:

Identify the list: Look for words or phrases that indicate a list or series of items, such as &quot;and,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; &quot;not only... but also,&quot; &quot;as well as,&quot; etc.

Analyze the structure: Examine the structure of each item in the list. Items should be in the same form (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, or phrases) and should follow the same pattern.

Check for consistency: Make sure that the items in the list are consistent in terms of tense, voice, and other grammatical aspects.

Simplify the sentence: If you're having trouble identifying the parallel elements, try simplifying the sentence by removing extra words or phrases. This can help you see the underlying structure more clearly."

Answer choice A states that couples with matched sleeping and waking cycles also have arguments that can jeopardize their marriages. While this does show that other factors can lead to marital problems, it does not directly address or challenge the relationship between mismatched sleeping and waking cycles and marital problems, which is the main claim of the argument.

The argument is not claiming that mismatched cycles are the only cause of marital problems. Instead, it is asserting that mismatched cycles can seriously jeopardize a marriage. Answer choice A doesn't provide any information that challenges this assertion or suggests that mismatched cycles are not harmful.

On the other hand, answer choice D directly weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the observed correlation between mismatched sleeping and waking cycles and marital problems. If people in unhappy marriages adopt different cycles as a way to express hostility, it suggests that the underlying issue is not the mismatched cycles themselves, but the pre-existing unhappiness and hostility in the marriage.

Option D uses &quot;its,&quot; which could potentially refer to another singular noun within the sentence, creating ambiguity. Option E, on the other hand, uses &quot;the corporation's,&quot; which clearly refers back to the mentioned corporation earlier in the sentence. Even though the word &quot;corporation&quot; is repeated, it ensures clarity in the sentence, which is a priority in GMAT Sentence Correction.

Why it's the correct answer:

It uses the correct pronoun &quot;it&quot; to refer to the singular &quot;rate increase.&quot;
The sentence is structured to indicate that the prediction was specifically &quot;that the increase would make further rate increases unnecessary,&quot; which clearly communicates the intended meaning.
Test maker's psychology:

The test maker wants to assess your understanding of pronoun usage, sentence structure, and clarity of meaning.
Trap answers:

(A) and (B) use the pronoun &quot;they&quot; incorrectly, as it should be &quot;it&quot; to refer to the singular &quot;rate increase.&quot;
(C) has an awkward sentence structure that makes the meaning unclear.
(E) incorrectly uses the future tense &quot;will,&quot; which is inconsistent with the past prediction.
How test takers can fall into traps:

They may not recognize the incorrect pronoun usage in (A) and (B).
They may not notice the awkward structure in (C).
They may not catch the incorrect tense in (E).
Be cautious about choosing an option based on brevity alone. While conciseness is often preferred in GMAT Sentence Correction, it's essential to prioritize the clarity of meaning and correct grammar. In this case, option D might seem longer, but it conveys the intended meaning more accurately. Pay close attention to verb tenses. Option E uses the future tense &quot;will,&quot; which is inconsistent with the past prediction. In contrast, option D maintains the correct tense with &quot;would make.&quot;"

SC,Incorrect,D,E,600-650,"Idioms/Diction/Redundancy, Idioms/Diction/Redundancy","Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The correct answer choice is &quot;almost all of whom play as well&quot;.

The test maker's psychology:
The test maker created this question to test students' understanding of relative pronouns (who/whom/which), adverb vs. adjective usage (good/well), and idiomatic expressions (almost all vs. most all).

Trap answers:
A. &quot;most all of which play as good&quot; - &quot;most all&quot; is incorrect; &quot;which&quot; should be &quot;whom&quot;; &quot;good&quot; should be &quot;well&quot;
B. &quot;most all of whom play as good&quot; - &quot;most all&quot; is incorrect; &quot;good&quot; should be &quot;well&quot;
C. &quot;almost all of which play as well&quot; - &quot;which&quot; should be &quot;whom&quot;
D. &quot;almost all of whom play as good&quot; - &quot;good&quot; should be &quot;well&quot;

How test-takers can fall into the traps:

Test-takers may not know the correct idiomatic expression, leading them to choose &quot;most all&quot; instead of &quot;almost all&quot;.
Test-takers may not recognize that &quot;whom&quot; should be used instead of &quot;which&quot; when referring to people.
Test-takers may confuse adjectives and adverbs, leading them to choose &quot;good&quot; instead of the correct adverb &quot;well&quot;.
in this context, 'well' is the appropriate choice. 'Good' is an adjective, while 'well' is an adverb. Since you are describing how the students play (an action), you need an adverb.
To improve your understanding of adjectives vs. adverbs, remember that adjectives describe nouns or pronouns, while adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. In this sentence, you want to describe the verb 'play,' so you need an adverb (well) instead of an adjective (good)."

Option C: larger than that of any other

Incorrect because &quot;that&quot; is singular, and we're discussing &quot;brains&quot; which is plural.
Option D: larger than those of any other

Correct because &quot;those&quot; is plural and agrees with &quot;brains.&quot;
To avoid similar errors in the future:

Pay attention to noun agreement: Make sure to match singular nouns with singular pronouns and plural nouns with plural pronouns.

Identify the comparison being made: Ensure that the comparison is logical and parallel. In this case, &quot;elephant brains&quot; should be compared to the &quot;brains of other land animals&quot; and not the &quot;land animals&quot; themselves.

In Option A, the pronoun 'they' correctly refers to the revolution's leaders. It is important to maintain parallelism in the sentence: &quot;...the revolution's leaders resorted to... and they suppressed...&quot; Both parts of the sentence use the same subject, the revolution's leaders, making the sentence clear and concise.

In Option B, the pronoun 'it' is ambiguous because it could refer to either the revolution or the violent means. Using 'it' instead of 'they' creates confusion about the subject, which makes Option B less clear than Option A.

In Option A, the infinitive &quot;to establish their authority&quot; and the independent clause &quot;they suppressed dissent ruthlessly&quot; are connected using the conjunction 'and'. This clearly shows that both actions are taken by the revolution's leaders. In Option B, the use of &quot;that&quot; makes the sentence less concise and changes the structure, creating confusion about the subject and the actions taken.

When approaching such questions, focus on the clarity of the sentence, parallelism, and subject-verb agreement. In this case, Option A maintains parallelism and has a clear subject, making it the better choice.

To avoid similar errors in the future, keep these tips in mind:

Ensure that pronouns have clear antecedents and avoid using ambiguous pronouns.
Maintain parallelism in the sentence structure.
Check for subject-verb agreement and clarity of meaning.

Argument:

Value Investing Based Mutual Fund (VBMF) has been traditionally considered a safe investment.
Last year, VBMF lost 24% of its capitalization.
The author concludes that investors should reassess their decision parameters, as investing in VBMF can lead to losses similar to those in other mutual funds.
The author's argument is based on the assumption that the loss in VBMF is comparable to losses in other mutual funds, making VBMF no safer than other options. To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that shows VBMF has some advantage or differentiating factor that still makes it a safer or more attractive choice for investors.

Now let's examine option E:

E) VBMFs provide the additional advantage of dividend payouts that other mutual funds do not provide.

Thought process:

The author's argument is focused on capitalization loss, implying that VBMF is no safer than other mutual funds due to the 24% loss.
Option E introduces a new piece of information: VBMFs provide dividend payouts, an advantage that other mutual funds don't have.
This additional advantage (dividend payouts) can offset some of the losses in capitalization, potentially leading to overall better returns compared to other mutual funds that only rely on capital gains.
Given this advantage, investors might still consider VBMF as a safer or more attractive investment, despite the capitalization loss.
By presenting this additional benefit of VBMFs, option E weakens the author's argument that VBMFs are no safer than other mutual funds. It shows that VBMFs have a distinct advantage that could make them more attractive to investors, even after experiencing a significant loss."

In option B, the use of &quot;but&quot; introduces a contrast that is not necessary in this context. The sentence does not intend to emphasize a contrast between blind and sighted people; instead, it highlights the unexpected similarity in their gesturing behavior.

C) You chose this option because &quot;had a floor that was curved upward&quot; seemed correct to you. However, the sentence structure is incorrect, as it creates a sentence fragment. The subject &quot;Conestoga wagons&quot; is missing a verb.

D) This option correctly places the verb &quot;had&quot; after &quot;Conestoga wagons,&quot; forming a complete sentence. It maintains parallelism between &quot;had high wheels&quot; and &quot;a floor that was curved upward.&quot;

To avoid making a similar mistake in the future, pay close attention to sentence structure and ensure that each sentence has a subject and a verb. In this case, option C created a sentence fragment, which is grammatically incorrect. Option D, on the other hand, provides a complete sentence with a clear subject and verb.

Remember to double-check the sentence structure when making your final decision, as it can help you identify and eliminate incorrect options."

Option B, C and E remained. After that I eliminated option E, because 'recup for' is un-idiomatic.

Please analyse my thought process, and, use the 'metacognition first' approach, and guide me accordingly, on how to improve myself so that I don't make a similar mistake on another sentence, on the GMAT sentence. If required, you can ask me additional questions. 

GPT: Thank you for sharing your thought process. It's helpful to understand where you might need some guidance. In this case, your reasoning for eliminating options A, D, and E was correct. However, let's analyze why option C is incorrect and option B is the correct choice.

The original sentence is:

Under the new corporate insurance policy, when an employer is charged for damages to a third party wholly or largely as a result of actions by an employee, he is entitled to recoup the amount of the damages.

(C) he or she is entitled to recoup

Although option C seems to address the gender issue by using &quot;he or she,&quot; it still has a pronoun reference problem. The pronoun &quot;he or she&quot; is ambiguous because it is not clear whether it refers to the employer or the employee. In GMAT Sentence Correction questions, clarity and precision are crucial, so any ambiguity should be avoided.

(B) the employer is entitled to recoup

Option B replaces the pronoun &quot;he&quot; with &quot;the employer,&quot; which clearly refers back to the noun &quot;employer&quot; and eliminates the ambiguity present in option C. As a result, option B is the correct choice.

In future questions, make sure to consider the clarity and precision of pronoun references in addition to gender neutrality. When you encounter sentences with pronouns, ask yourself if the reference is clear and unambiguous."

Let's analyze each option and identify the gaps:

(A) the army of terra-cotta warriors created to protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife is more than 2,000 years old and took 700,000 artisans more than 36 years to complete

This sentence is clear, concise, and effectively communicates the information.
(B) Qin Shi huang, China's first emperor, was protected in his afterlife by an army of terracotta warriors that was created more than 2,000 years ago by 700,000 artisans who took more than 36 years to complete it

This sentence is wordy and shifts the focus from the army of terra-cotta warriors to Qin Shi Huang. The original sentence intended to emphasize the army's achievement.
(C) it took 700,000 artisans more than 36 years to create an army of terra-cotta warriors more than 2,000 years ago that would protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife

This sentence is wordy and awkwardly structured.
(D) more than 2,000 years ago, 700,000 artisans worked more than 36 years to create an army of terra-cotta warriors to protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife

This sentence changes the meaning by implying that the artisans worked for more than 36 years, rather than the project taking more than 36 years to complete.
(E) more than 36 years were needed to complete the army of terra-cotta warriors that 700,000 artisans created 2,000 years ago to protect Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, in his afterlife

This sentence is passive and wordy, making it less clear and concise than option (A).
The gap in your understanding seems to be focusing on the sentence's clarity and conciseness. In GMAT sentence correction, it's essential to prioritize clear, concise sentences that effectively communicate the intended meaning. When in doubt, try to break down each answer choice and compare them to find the one that presents the information most clearly and concisely. Remember that relying on"

The correct answer is option E. The primary issue with option D is the use of &quot;if&quot; instead of &quot;whether.&quot; In this context, &quot;whether&quot; is the appropriate word to use because it introduces a choice between two alternatives (signing the no-buy pledge or not signing it). &quot;If&quot; is used to introduce a conditional statement, which is not suitable for this context.

So, the correct sentence is:

The first decision for most tenants living in a building undergoing conversion to cooperative ownership is whether to sign a no-buy pledge with the other tenants.

To avoid making similar mistakes in the future, make sure to carefully consider the context and the meaning of the sentence when choosing between words like &quot;if&quot; and &quot;whether.&quot; Remember that &quot;whether&quot; is used to introduce a choice or alternatives, while &quot;if&quot; is used for conditional statements. Practice GMAT questions that test your understanding of these nuances, and review explanations for both correct and incorrect answers to reinforce your understanding."

It's important to note that the original sentence could be interpreted as suggesting that Albert Einstein was currently in childhood when he was told that his intelligence was minimal, which doesn't make sense given that Einstein was an adult when he gained fame for his scientific work.

By using the adverbial phrase &quot;As a child,&quot; the sentence makes it clear that the action of being told about his intelligence happened when Einstein was a child. This phrasing makes much more sense in the context of Einstein's life and allows the sentence to convey its intended meaning more clearly.

In GMAT sentence correction questions, it's important to pay attention to subtle details like verb tense and word choice in order to identify the correct answer. In this case, understanding the difference between &quot;As being in childhood&quot; and &quot;As a child&quot; is crucial to selecting the correct answer.

B. the thorough attempt to gauge the impact
Removing &quot;most&quot; changes the meaning of the sentence. It is no longer suggesting that the study is superior to all others in thoroughness, merely that it is a thorough attempt. This doesn't match the intended meaning of the original sentence.

C. a most thorough attempt to gauge the impact

1. &quot;Whether&quot; is used when there are two or more alternatives or choices. It is often used with &quot;or not&quot; to indicate the two choices. For example:

   - I don't know whether I should go to the party or not.
   - The teacher will decide whether the test will be multiple choice or essay.

2. &quot;If&quot; is used to introduce a condition or requirement. It is used in conditional sentences to express a consequence that depends on the fulfillment of a condition. For example:

   - If it rains, we will stay at home.
   - You will pass the test if you study hard.

In the context of the GMAT Sentence Correction, &quot;whether&quot; is often preferred over &quot;if&quot; when expressing uncertainty or when two alternatives are presented. 

For example, consider the sentence: &quot;The manager is deciding if he should hire more staff.&quot; In this case, &quot;if&quot; would be better replaced with &quot;whether&quot; because there are two alternatives - hiring more staff or not hiring more staff. So the corrected sentence would be: &quot;The manager is deciding whether he should hire more staff.&quot;

Remember, these are general guidelines and there may be exceptions based on the specific context of the sentence. Always consider the meaning and context when choosing between &quot;whether&quot; and &quot;if&quot;."

&quot;Who&quot; is a subject pronoun, similar to &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; &quot;it,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; and &quot;they.&quot; It's used when the pronoun acts as the subject of a clause.
Example: &quot;Who is going to the store?&quot; (Who is the subject of the sentence.)

&quot;Whom&quot; is an object pronoun, similar to &quot;him,&quot; &quot;her,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; and &quot;them.&quot; It's used when the pronoun acts as the object of a clause.
Example: &quot;Whom are you going to the store with?&quot; (Whom is the object of the preposition &quot;with.&quot;)

In the sentence you provided, &quot;whom&quot; is used correctly because it is the object of the verb &quot;known&quot;. The full clause is &quot;one of whom was known to be a rival of the author&quot;, where &quot;one&quot; is the subject, &quot;was known&quot; is the verb, and &quot;whom&quot; is the object of the verb.

A good trick to decide whether to use &quot;who&quot; or &quot;whom&quot; is to answer the question with &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot;. If &quot;he&quot; sounds correct, you should use &quot;who&quot;, and if &quot;him&quot; sounds correct, you should use &quot;whom&quot;. For example, in the question &quot;Who/Whom are you going to the store with?&quot;, if you answer &quot;I am going to the store with him&quot;, you can tell that &quot;whom&quot; is the correct choice because &quot;him&quot; is used in the answer."

Option A: &quot;Once thought to be impossible, Alex Honnold successfully ???free soloed??? Yosemite???s El Capitan in 2017, climbing the 3,000-foot wall without the aid of any ropes in just under four hours.&quot;

The problem with this sentence is that the phrase &quot;Once thought to be impossible&quot; is a dangling modifier. A dangling modifier is a word or phrase that modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence. In this case, it's not clear what was once thought to be impossible. The structure of the sentence makes it seem like Alex Honnold was once thought to be impossible, which doesn't make sense.

Option E: &quot;In 2017, Alex Honnold became the first person to ???free solo??? Yosemite???s El Capitan???a feat once thought impossible???climbing the 3,000-foot wall without the aid of any ropes in just under four hours.&quot;

This sentence correctly places the phrase &quot;a feat once thought impossible&quot; immediately after &quot;free solo&quot; Yosemite???s El Capitan, making it clear that the feat of free soloing El Capitan was what was once thought to be impossible. The sentence is also correctly structured in terms of tense and subject-verb agreement.

The key to understanding this question is understanding the concept of dangling modifiers. A modifier describes, clarifies, or gives more detail about a concept. When a modifier is not clearly connected to the concept it describes, it is called a dangling modifier.

For example, consider the sentence: &quot;Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful.&quot; The modifier &quot;Walking down the street&quot; is dangling because it is not clear who or what was walking down the street. A corrected version of the sentence could be: &quot;Walking down the street, I thought the trees were beautiful.&quot;"

Let's understand where I made the error:

Premise:
Candidates who were leading in pre-election polls failed to win election to office.

Conclusion: American electoral system clearly possesses deep flaws and must be discarded

Because the pre-poll leader failed to win, we are concluding that the electoral system has deep flaws.

A. The candidate leading in pre-election polls won a majority of the popular vote in the actual election yet still failed to be elected.

We are not assuming that the candidate won a majority of the popular vote. We don't know what the flaws are. The flaw could be that the candidate leading in pre-election poll did not win majority in actual election. All we know is that the one leading in pre-election polls failed to be elected.

B. The voting population did not significantly alter its feelings on which candidate was preferred during the time interval between the pre-election polls and the actual election.

This is correct. We need this to be true (it is necessary) for the conclusion to hold. We need the voting population to not significantly alter its feelings. Only then will the pre election leader win and we won't conclude that the system has deep flaws."

Sure, I'd be happy to clarify the difference between the past perfect tense and the simple past tense, and why the past perfect tense is not appropriate in this context.

Past Perfect Tense: The past perfect tense is used to indicate an action that occurred before another action in the past. It is formed with &quot;had&quot; + past participle. For example, &quot;I had eaten dinner when he arrived.&quot; Here, the action of eating dinner occurred before another action in the past (he arrived).

Simple Past Tense: The simple past tense is used to describe an action that occurred and was completed at a specific time in the past. It is formed with the past tense form of the verb. For example, &quot;I ate dinner at 7pm.&quot;

In the context of the sentence you provided, the past perfect tense (&quot;had directed&quot;) would suggest that Rembrandt's action of directing his apprentices to copy his self-portraits occurred before another past action. However, there is no other past action mentioned in the sentence for it to precede.

The simple past tense (&quot;directed&quot;) is more appropriate because it simply states that this action occurred in the past, without implying that it preceded another action.

So, the correct answer is (C): &quot;has revealed that the seventeenth-century artist often directed his apprentices to copy his own self-portraits.&quot;

I hope this helps clarify the difference between these two tenses and why the past perfect tense is not appropriate in this context. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Yes, you're correct. The two events are independent of each other and do not occur in a sequence that requires the use of the past perfect tense.

The event of the &quot;history journals revealing&quot; something is not dependent on the event of the &quot;artist directing his apprentices.&quot; They are two separate actions that happened at different times."
